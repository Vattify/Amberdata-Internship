	I will be continuing on Amberdata's re-branding update, which'll include making a consistant images and brand throughout all the social media platforms, so far the profile image icons have all been made, now I'm continuing onto header images, and hopefully try a few styles, and see which one stands out the most.

	Well as you all know Amberdata is now newly supporting Aion, and to let our users know about this exciting new addition today I'll be working on making the Announcement Header for it. Afterwards I'll be working on a re-branding update as the Amberdata logo had a color switch and other slight changes made to it, so I'll be making the necessary files for the change as well as creating a consistant social media brand.
